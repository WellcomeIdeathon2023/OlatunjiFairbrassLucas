# Droughts and Despair: An Innovative Tool for Policy-Makers to Assess Climate Change's Economic Impact on “Diseases of Despair” in Farming Communities

This repository contains the code and data for our project in the Wellcome Data Science Ideathon. The project aims to create an innovative tool that can be used by policy-makers to assess the economic impact of climate change on mental health in farming communities.

The repository is organized as follows:

* `data` - Shapefile of India, the second addministrative level (Divisions).
* `code` - The shiny app code and the r code for the simulation of the data used.
* `results` - The slides and the research proposal.

To run the shiny app, you will need to install R and the shiny package. Once you have installed R, you can run the app by opening the code/CEHAPP_v2.R file in RStudio.

The research proposal and slides are also available in the results folder.

We hope that this tool will be a valuable resource for policy-makers as they work to address the mental health challenges facing farming communities in the face of climate change.
